* A new function, getOrderedMatrix, for ordering the empirical matrix according individuals' NormDS values is included in this new version.
* getinterc is eliminated in this version.
* Methods for quantifying and testing steepness from matrices of win proportions are implemented.
* getw1, getw2, getl1 and getl2 functions in previous version are gathered now in a unique function called getwl.
* "for" loops eliminated in all the functions of steepness package.
* All functions are now constrained to be used for square and numerical matrices.
* cross-calling to steepness functions is avoided in the new version.
* A more efficient way of computing steepness measure, via lm function, is now implemented in getStp, getplot and steeptest functions. 
* Some modifications of the C routine included in the package.
* Improvements in Rd files. New examples for illustrative purposes.
